# Release Notes

## Overview
**With each milestone, provide a _brief_ summary of the implementation that was completed.**

These notes should include what is done, how to launch/test it, and any known bugs. _(These release notes should also be included in the tag itself.)_

## Milestone 1
- ...The external tool was not implemented during milestone 1, but the idea was discussed. It is intended for loading levels.
- ...

## Milestone 2
- ...The implementation of the external tool for milestone 2 has started. It loads a level with a .txt file, and can be tested when the player tries to load a level. However, this only counts for a tutorial level and not for any physically playable stages.
- ...A bug regarding the external tool takes place with the stable shapes. The data from the .txt file is supposed to load the stable shapes inside the level, however the stable shape always returns null. For now the stable shapes had to be hard-coded.
