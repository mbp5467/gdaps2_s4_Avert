# Release Notes

## Overview
**With each milestone, provide a _brief_ summary of the implementation that was completed.**

These notes should include what is done, how to launch/test it, and any known bugs. _(These release notes should also be included in the tag itself.)_

## Milestone 1
- ...Milestone 1 lightly implemented the core classes and state machines, along with transitions using user input. 

## Milestone 2
- ...Milestone 2 expanded on the implementation greatly by implementing the external tool, and all of the code for the child classes needed from their respective abstract classes.

## Milestone 3
- ...Milestone 3 has a fully functional game. There are 5 levels, and the external tool is used with a Windows UI program that saves to a .txt file based on what the user wants the levels to contain.
- ...An issue with the external tool is the fact that it only allows a 5x5 grid to be saved and loaded. Anything else will crash the program. We wanted to have the levels be fully customizable, but time restraints prevented that.
